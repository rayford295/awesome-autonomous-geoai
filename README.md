## Intership
### **Esri (Environmental Systems Research Institute)**  
*Focus:* GeoAI · Spatial Data Science · GIScience · AI-Integrated GIS  

Esri provides selective internship opportunities suitable for graduate students and PhD researchers working at the intersection of **geographic information science (GIScience)** and **artificial intelligence**. In addition to traditional GIS roles, Esri maintains dedicated **research- and GeoAI-oriented teams** that focus on spatial machine learning, deep learning for geospatial data, and the integration of AI models into GIS platforms.

**Relevant internship tracks include:**
- Research Intern (GeoAI / Spatial Data Science)
- AI / Machine Learning Intern (Geospatial focus)
- Spatial Data Science Intern

These internships typically emphasize:
- Spatial representation learning and geospatial machine learning
- Integration of deep learning models with GIS workflows (e.g., ArcGIS, spatial databases)
- Applied research with potential pathways to publications or long-term research collaboration

*Location:* Redlands, CA  
*International students:* CPT / J-1 supported for research-oriented roles  
*Website:* https://www.esri.com/careers

> **Note:** Applicants should distinguish research- and AI-focused internships from general GIS or cartography roles, which are more application-oriented and less aligned with research-driven GeoAI trajectories.
