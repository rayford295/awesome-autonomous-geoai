# Research Philosophy

This project begins with a simple but enduring belief:

That **ambition gives direction**,  
that **courage sustains exploration**,  
and that **reading is often the first act of serious thinking**.

Long before models, benchmarks, or systems, research starts with curiosity —
a willingness to question what is known, to read deeply, and to imagine what might be possible.
Books, papers, and ideas encountered through reading do not merely transmit knowledge;
they quietly shape how we see the world, how we frame problems,
and how far we are willing to think beyond established boundaries.

Pursuing research, especially in emerging fields such as GeoAI and AI4Science,
requires a particular kind of courage:
the courage to cross disciplines,
to work at the intersection of geography, artificial intelligence, and Earth system science,
and to accept uncertainty as an essential part of discovery.

This repository is built not only as a collection of resources,
but as a reflection of a research journey guided by **intellectual ambition**,
sustained by **curiosity and courage**,
and continuously refined through **reading, learning, and critical reflection**.

What follows is both a map of ideas and an invitation:
to read carefully, to think spatially,
and to explore how autonomous intelligence can deepen our understanding of the Earth and its complex systems.
