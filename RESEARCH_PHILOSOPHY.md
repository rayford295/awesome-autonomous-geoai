# Research Philosophy

This project begins with a simple but enduring belief:

That **ambition gives direction**,  
that **courage sustains exploration**,  
and that **reading is often the first act of serious thinking**.

Long before models, benchmarks, or systems, research starts with curiosity —
a willingness to question what is known, to read deeply, and to imagine what might be possible.
Books, papers, and ideas encountered through reading do not merely transmit knowledge;
they quietly shape how we see the world, how we frame problems,
and how far we are willing to think beyond established boundaries.

Pursuing research, especially in emerging fields such as GeoAI and AI4Science,
requires a particular kind of courage:
the courage to cross disciplines,
to work at the intersection of geography, artificial intelligence, and Earth system science,
and to accept uncertainty as an essential part of discovery.

This repository is built not only as a collection of resources,
but as a reflection of a research journey guided by **intellectual ambition**,
sustained by **curiosity and courage**,
and continuously refined through **reading, learning, and critical reflection**.

What follows is both a map of ideas and an invitation:
to read carefully, to think spatially,
and to explore how autonomous intelligence can deepen our understanding of the Earth and its complex systems.

用发展的眼光看问题，这是一份终身职业，一份与你的一切不能分割的工作，有意义的失败远远比无意义的成果的有价值。狠狠地操练自己，你越强，找到你的观众越多。而不是你能讨好的人越多，你的观众越多。炸场是副产品，正如名利也是副产品。人是目的，不是手段。--《李诞脱口秀工作手册》

好好活就是做有意义的事，做有意义的事，就是好好活。
早熟的人吧，通常都晚熟。骄傲的人又很性急。
想要和得到，中间还有两个字，那就是要做到，你只有做到，才能得到。--《士兵突击》
